1.Checking OpenGL ES Version
软件支持：官方参考:OpenGL ES 3.0-This API specification is supported by Android 4.3 (API level 18) and higher.
硬件支持：运行时判断
2.使用方式
Both framework API and NDK
3.重要类
GLSurfaceView and GLSurfaceView.Render
GLSurfaceView:
    This class is a View where you can draw and manipulate objects using OpenGL API calls and is similar in
    function to a SurfaceView. You can use this class by creating an instance of GLSurfaceView and adding
    your Renderer to it. However, if you want to capture touch screen events, you should extend the
    GLSurfaceView class to implement the touch listeners




4.使用步骤
4.1声明OpenGL Requirements
#OpenGL Es version requirements:
    $code$:
    <!-- Tell the system this app requires OpenGL ES 3.0. -->
    <uses-feature android:glEsVersion="0x00030000" android:required="true" />

#Texture compression requirements
    If your application uses texture compression formats, you must declare the formats your application supports in your manifest file using <supports-gl-texture>
